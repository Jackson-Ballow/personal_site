# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal portfolio website repo! This is where I showcase my projects, skills, and what I've been working on.

## What's this all about?

Just my corner of the internet where I get to show off some cool stuff I've built. The star of the show is **Desync AI** - an AI-powered Excel assistant that helps people analyze data and scrape the web without writing code.

## What's inside?

- ðŸŽ¨ A clean, modern portfolio design
- ðŸŽ¥ Demo videos showing Desync AI in action
- ðŸ’» Info about my tech stack and skills
- ðŸ“« Ways to get in touch

## Tech used

Built with good ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Nothing too fancy - just clean, responsive code that works.

## Want to check it out?

The site is live at [coming soon - GitHub Pages deployment pending]
